# always_enough_toilet_paper


# Purpose
The purpose of this application is to make it easier for people who live in a shared appartment to manage shooping. This will be made easier with a shared shopping list where people that live together can add items that needs to be bought. Then if anyone buys it it will be marked as bought and removed from the shared shopping list so everyone knows it has been bought, and you avoid buying too much of one item. This will likely also reduce the chance of a household running out of toilet paper. The application will also track who owes who how much money.
