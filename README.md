# always_enough_toilet_paper


# Purpose
The purpose of this application is to make it easier for people to live in a shared appartment to manage shooping. This will be made easier with a shared shopping list where people that live together can add items that needs to be bought. Then if anyone buys it it will be removed from the shared shopping list so everyone knows it has been bought, and you avoid buying to much of one item. This will likely also reduce the change of a household running out of toilet paper. The application will also track who owes who how much money.
